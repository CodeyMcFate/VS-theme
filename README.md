## About

This theme is designed to have vivid colors to capture youre attention yet be
easy on the eyes. Originally based on the color theme VS Dark+, Gruvbox Dark and
One Dark but has changed a lot since. It is designed for web languages (HTML,
CSS, JS, and more).

## Tips for modifying the theme.

- `tmTheme` is not being used since I think the default VS Dark+ works better
  for syntax highlighting & (seems to) require fewer configurations
- In the `json` file, `scope` can be an `array` or a `string` of CSS classes
- VS Code's dev tools (`Help > Toggle Developer Tools`) are very helpful to find
  out the scopes.
