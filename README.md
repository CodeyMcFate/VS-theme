## About
This theme is designed to have vivid colors to capture youre attension yet be easy on the eyes. Originally based on the color theme VS Dark+, Gruvbox Dark and One Dark but has changed a lot since. It is designed for web languages (HTML, CSS, JS and more).


## Tips for modifying the theme.
 - `tmTheme` is not being used since I think the default VS Dark+ works better for syntax highlighting & (seems to) require fewer configurations
 - In the `json` file, `scope` can be an `array` or a `string` of CSS classes
 - VSCode's dev tools (`Help > Toggle Developer Tools`) is very helpful to find
 out the scopes.
